Hello &#128075;&#127995;, I'm Miller. Born and raised in the midwest,
        I've been using & building computers since I was a kid. Enrolling in my
        first programming class in highschool with Al Miner, he gave me the
        ability to see how computers can make my ideas come to life.
<br data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6> <br data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>
I graduated and went to the University of Kansas, not knowing what a
        Software Engineer was or what I was going to do with my life. I started
        with my core credits by taking any class I found compelling. Film,
        Sociology(<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LxAnxXoAAAAJ&hl=en" data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>William G. Staples</a>), Philsophy, Photography (<a href="https://www.mikesinclair.com/" data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>Mike Sinclair</a>, whom I have great respect for), and Geology all of which I look back
        on fondly. As time progressed, I needed to decide on a major.
<br data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6> <br data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>
In my second year, I googled "programming job security" and saw that it
        was a growing industry. With that, I enrolled in all my basic Computer
        Science classes for the next semster. They were extremely challenging,
        and I came very close to abandoning the program. The first day of the
        Engineering seminar class <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/clayton-beabout/" data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>Clay Beabout</a> sat down next to me and introduced himself. We quickly became friends and
        stuck by each others side throughout our degree. I credit to both him and
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaitlin-o-brien-350a1a158/" data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>Kaitlin O'Brien</a> for keeping me from dropping out of the CS program.
<br data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6> <br data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>
I joined the Association for Computing Machinery at KU and found myself
        motivated enough to participate in building a community of engineers and
        nerds. For the first time in a while, I felt that I was where I was
        supposed to be.
<br data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6> <br data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>
Unbeknownst to me, the decisions I made in those few short months would
        go on to shape, what feels like to me, the rest of my life.
<br data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6> <br data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>
I met <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LxAnxXoAAAAJ&hl=en" data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>Phillip Swope</a> at a KU recruiting fair in late 2019, a recruiter for PayIt. I asked if
        I could message him after graduation about a full time position, to which
        he said "sure". When that time came in the Winter of 2020, I interviewed
        and joined PayIt, where I still work today.
<br data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6> <br data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6>
My first four years at PayIt were spent fixing critical production
        issues, leading client-facing incidents, ideating and implementing
        internal tooling, and helping mentor and hire interns. Currently I'm
        working as a Software Engineer on the Outdoor Production Response team,
        rapidly identifying and resolving production issues for our clients to
        maintain go-live schedules.
