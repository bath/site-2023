                Hello &#128075;&#127995;, I'm miller. Born and raised in the midwest, 
                computers were the first thing I loved. As a boy I played video games and
                took as many computer classes as I could. Through highschool I found programming
                to be extremely difficult but rewarding. Sticking with it through college, now
                I program for a living.
            </span>

                Working in groups and a fast paced environment is something I'm always looking for.
                Reach out to me via my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/~miller">LinkedIn</a>
                or my <a href="mailto:millerzbath@gmail.com">email</a>.
